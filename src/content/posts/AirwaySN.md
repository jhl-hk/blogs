[Airway Simulation Network (AirwaySN/ASN)](https://airwaysn.org) is a passion project created by my friends and me with one clear mission: to build a high-quality flight simulation network experience for a dedicated community of aviation enthusiasts. We're committed to maintaining professional standards and delivering excellence in every aspect of our platform.

## How It All Started

Our journey began on March 6th, 2025, sparked by a simple but powerful idea. One of my friends had the technical expertise to develop software for Microsoft Flight Simulator, while I could handle the server infrastructure. With complementary skills and shared enthusiasm, we decided to bring our vision to life.

Initially, we planned to build everything from the ground up—creating our own protocols, backend systems, and client software. While this approach would give us complete control, we quickly realized it would require significant time and resources. After exploring various options on GitHub, we discovered an existing project that provided a solid foundation. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we decided to adapt this solution, using established FSD protocols while adding our own custom features to create a unique experience for our users.

## Alpha Testing Phase

We launched our alpha test on April 13th, 2025, using Swift and EuroScope as our primary software platforms alongside our custom front-end website. The response exceeded our expectations—throughout the alpha phase, we welcomed over 20 participants who joined as either pilots or air traffic controllers.

This period was crucial for establishing our foundation. We developed our initial controller team structure, created basic operational policies, and began building the community culture that would define AirwaySN. The enthusiasm and feedback from our early adopters gave us the confidence to move forward to the next phase of development.

## Beta Testing and Beyond

Our beta phase represents a significant evolution of the platform. We're currently undertaking an ambitious rewrite of our entire backend system to support a broader range of existing flight simulation clients. One of our most exciting developments is the creation of our own audio client, which will provide seamless voice communication for our community.

We've also expanded our controller training program, welcoming experienced controllers from other networks who bring valuable expertise and help us maintain the professional standards we strive for. Having these seasoned professionals join our team has been instrumental in elevating the quality of our air traffic control services.

As we celebrate our two-month milestone, we're proud of how far we've come and excited about what lies ahead. The beta phase continues to be a period of rapid development and growth, setting the stage for our official launch.

## Looking Forward

AirwaySN represents more than just another flight simulation network—it's a community built on passion, professionalism, and the shared love of aviation. We're committed to creating an environment where both new and experienced pilots and controllers can enjoy realistic, high-quality simulation experiences.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and refine our platform. We're excited to share this journey with the aviation simulation community.
